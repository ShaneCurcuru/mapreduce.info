##Map Reduce Software

The most widely used software for running Map Reduce is [Apache&reg; Hadoop&reg;](http://hadoop.apache.org/).

Accept no substitutes!  Run the original Apache Hadoop from the Apache Software Foundation.  Or, explore the many other big data software products hosted at the ASF, including [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).
