Map/Reduce is a [programming model or algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) for usefully processing big data into useful insights.  It has nothing to do with **what** analysis you want to do on your databases, or how you get your data, but rather is the model that allows you to scale how you run your analysis over massive amounts of data, without requiring expensive or dedicated resources.
